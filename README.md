# CS415Proj2

1. ```output()``` needs to be written
    - implement with ```DAG``` class
    
2. ```createDAG()``` needs to be written
    - implement with ```DAG``` class
    - going to be a tree
    
3. need to create a topological sort function
    - see proj2 writeup for details
    
_NOTES_
- code is still untested
- make sure you understand what has been done
    
_**EXTRA CREDIT**_
- Implement the DAG in the adjacency list format (+10)
- Implement the topological sorting method using the queue-based decrease-by-one design method (+10)
